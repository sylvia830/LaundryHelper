##LaundryHelper

Description:

- **_What will the application do?_** 
LaundryHelp is set to provide users with information in terms of the machine availability, laundry card balance. 
This app would be extremely convenient for users as the information would assist them in planning their laundry. 
The users are able to check if the machines are available and get a list of the occupied machines as well as manage the 
balance on their laundry card. 
   
- **_Who will use it?_** 
The major users of this helper app would be those who live in residential areas 
where residents need to share multiple washing machines and dryers. Specifically, this would be greatly appreciated 
by students in residence on campus.

- **_Why is this project of interest to me?_** 
Having experienced doing laundry in residence, I found it rather time-consuming especially during peak hours when one 
had to run up and downstairs several times just to find an available slot. With a helper as such, one can invest all 
that searching time on more urgent issues.
