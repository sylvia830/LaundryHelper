##LaundryHelper

Description:
- **_What will the application do?_** LaundryHelp is set to provide information in terms of the machine availability,
laundry card balance and give the user a heads-up when the task is finished. This would come extremely handy for the 
users as the information would save them a considerable amount of time in planning and doing their laundry. The users 
are able to check if the machines are available and get notified when the laundry is done, as well as manage the 
balance on their laundry card.    
- **_Who will use it?_** The major user of this little helper would be those who live in the kind of residential areas 
where residents need to share multiple washing machines. Specifically, this would be greatly appreciated for students in 
residence on campus.
- **_Why is this project of interest to me?_** Having experienced doing laundry in residence, I found it rather 
time-consuming especially during peak hours when one had to run up and downstairs several times just to find an 
available slot. With a helper as such, one can invest all that searching time on more urgent issues.
